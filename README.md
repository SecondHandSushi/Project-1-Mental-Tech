#  **Mental Health in Tech Jobs:** A Study of How Comfortable Employees in the Tech Field are Discussing Mental Health with their Employers.
## **Project Overview**
### **Team members:**
- Matthew Idle, Chad Fletcher, Lori Vitaioli, Brady Ogega, Cindy Hansel, Heather Shoberg, Jennifer White
### **Project Description:**
- This project seeks to determine trends and relationships in tech industry employeesâ€™ comfort in discussing mental health with their employers.
### **Research Questions:**
1. Which variables impact a technology employee's comfort/willingness to discuss mental health with employers?
2. Do employees feel more comfortable talking about physical or mental health?
3. What is the level of ease for taking a leave of absence for mental health in the tech industry?
### **Datasets Used:**
- https://osmihelp.org/research.html
- We utilized data sets for the 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 OSMI Mental Health in Tech surveys.
### **Survey Questions Analyzed:**
- What is your age?
- What is your gender?
- What country do you work in?
- Do you work remotely?
- How many employees does your company or organization have?
- Have you had a mental health disorder in the past?
- Do you currently have a mental health disorder?
- Would you be willing to bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
- Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
- Have you observed or experienced an unsupportive or badly handled response to a mental health issue in your current or previous workplace?*
- Have your observations of how another individual who discussed a mental health disorder made you less likely to reveal a mental health issue yourself in your current workplace?*
- Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health disorder with your direct supervisor(s)?
- Would you have been willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?*
- If a mental health issue prompted you to request a medical leave from work, asking for that leave would be:
- Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?
### **Data Cleanup:**
- Data cleanup can be found in two sets of code: Project-1.ipynb for cleaning only the 2016 survey and clean_2016-2019.ipynb for cleaning and merging all of the surveys. 
- Filtered the survey questions to the ones we were interested in analyzing. Renamed these columns from questions to shortened names to easily call them into code later. 
- Cleaned the age column by looking at ages between 18 to 98, which removed some outliers (3 years old, 99 years old, 323 years old). We then created bins to group the ages into ranges (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75+).
- The original gender question in the surveys allowed for open-ended responses, which resulted in there being hundreds of options for gender in the survey. To allow for easier analysis of the data based on gender, we created three overarching gender categories: male, female, and other. We conducted research to determine where to best place the various responses. We did omit responses that did not align with a gender grouping, such as "nan", "none of your business", "I am a Wookie", and "God King of the Valajar"
- For blank responses, we utilized the "fillna" function and filled those with "No Response" as those we intentionally left blank by survey respondents.
